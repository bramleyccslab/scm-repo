Rockslides, storms and tidal waves: things in the natural world **move**! But they move predictably under the laws of physics and the dangerous movements are fairly rare. Agents, on the other hand, move all the time and they are dangerous! How do we perceive agent-based motion?

## Questions under discussion

- Why do we privilege animate motion?
- Is there a sound biological basis for this privilege?
