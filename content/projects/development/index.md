Compared to other animals, humans are flexible generalists. We are born  “half baked”, with relatively little in the way of initial skills or “core knowledge”. We spend decades growing and maturing and even once mature can continue to be able to learn new things. This session will explore a zoomed out perspective on how the human mind achieves this impressive flexibility. This touches on how the ability to learn and change shifts over our lifespans and the benefits and costs of childlike cognition.

## Questions under discussion

- In what sense is childhood like simulated annealing?
- What is the “Child as scientist” theory of development?
- What might order effects in learning tasks reveal about about learning?
