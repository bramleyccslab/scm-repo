Memory is the process of encoding, storing, and retrieving information when it is needed. This topic will explore the structure and function of memory in cognitive systems and relate it to the other themes of the course.

## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss:

|  |  |
|:----:|:-----|
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Miller, G. A. (1956). | The magical number seven, plus or minus two: Some limits on our capacity for processing information. *Psychological Review*, 63(2), 81.| <!-- {{< details "">}}{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This highly cited article discusses the concept of information capacity and its implications for human cognition. Miller presents experiments on people's ability to assign numbers to stimuli, which test their capacity to transmit information. Miller introduces information theory and discusses the concept of channel capacity, which represents the maximum amount of information that an observer can provide about a stimulus through absolute judgment.{{</details>}}  -->

<!-- {{< details "">}}{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} The researchers, Collins and Quillian, conducted a series of experiments to investigate how people retrieve and process information from semantic memory. They proposed two hypotheses, the "unsuccessful search" hypothesis and the "search and destroy" hypothesis, to explain how individuals make judgments about the truth or falsity of sentences.

The experiments yielded contradictory results to the researchers' initial hypothesis, leading them to develop the "search and destroy" hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that individuals search for paths that connect the words in a sentence and reject the statement if they are unable to find a path that agrees with it.The researchers also discuss the issue of contradictions and emphasized that determining the falsity of a statement is not a simple process.{{</details>}} -->



## Secondary Readings

The presenter should read and incorporate at least two of these:

| |  |
|:----:|:-----|
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Atkinson, R. C., & Shiffrin, R. M. (1971). | {{< details "The control of short-term memory. *Scientific American*, 225(2), 82-91.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This article explores the mechanisms and processes involved in short-term memory. The authors discuss the capacity, duration, and attentional control of short-term memory. They propose a model known as the modal model of memory, which explains how information is encoded and retrieved in short-term memory. This study provides valuable insights into the functioning of short-term memory and underlying cognitive processes. The research by Murdock, Tulving, and Glanzer focuses on the probability of recalling items in a list based on their position. They identify a primacy effect for the first few words and a recency effect for the last few words on the list, which is attributed to retrieval from short-term storage. They also propose a mathematical model to explain these effects, supported by experiments involving overt rehearsal during list presentation.{{</details>}} |
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Collins, A. M., & Loftus, E. F. (1975). | {{< details "A spreading-activation theory of semantic processing. *Psychological Review*, 82(6), 407.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This paper presents a spreading-activation theory of human semantic processing that can account for recent experimental findings. The theory extends Quillian's theory of semantic memory search and priming, addressing misconceptions and proposing additional assumptions. It is shown to explain production and categorization experiments and critiques the Smith et al. model for categorization judgments. The theory suggests that activation spreads through a network of links in semantic memory, with activation decreasing as it moves outward. Concepts are stored in a lexical network based on similarity, and activation depends on priming and connections between concepts. The theory also discusses strategies for evaluating semantic matching and the role of properties and superordinate connections. It is applied to various experiments, including those on reaction times, category-instance relationships, negative instances, typicality, and semantic relatedness. The theory emphasizes the importance of considering different configurations of knowledge in memory and aims to provide a more powerful and flexible approach to understanding human semantic processing.{{</details>}} |
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Zhang, W., & Luck, S. J. (2008). | {{< details "Discrete fixed-resolution representations in visual working memory. *Nature*, 453(7192), 233-235.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} Researchers have been debating whether working memory stores a fixed set of representations or a flexible pool of resources. This study aimed to resolve this controversy by conducting four experiments using a short-term recall paradigm.

The results of Experiment 1 showed that humans store high-resolution representations of some objects and no information about others, ruling out models with varying resolutions. Experiment 2 supported the idea of fixed-resolution representations, as precision did not decrease with set size. Experiment 3 found that resources were allocated to cued items, enhancing precision. Experiment 4 demonstrated that durable memory representations involve an all-or-none encoding process for simple objects.

Overall, the study supports the notion of a small number of fixed-resolution representations in working memory. These representations are not affected by set size and are created through an all-or-none encoding process. The experiments provide insights into the capacity and resolution of visual working memory.

## Questions under discussion

- What are the differences between short term and long term memory. How are they thought to be interrelated?
- How does memory relate to the concepts, categories, learning and representation topics?
