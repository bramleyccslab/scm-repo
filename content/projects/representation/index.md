Cognitive Science is the science of mental representations and processes. But what *are* representations?

## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss:

|:----:|:-----|
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Markman, A.B. (1998) | {{< details "Knowledge Representation: Chapter One (on learn)" >}}
{{< icon name="chalkboard-teacher" pack="fas" >}} Pop out notes with a chalkboard item are guides from your instructors. This reading is on Learn.
<!-- {{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} The chapter focuses on mental representations and their role in understanding cognitive processes. It explores different ways of thinking about mental entities and their representation, such as goals, beliefs, and concepts, as well as processes like retrieval and reasoning. The chapter also discusses the role of logical reasoning and its application in tasks such as the Wason selection task. Additionally, the chapter explores the concept of representation in relation to temperature. It discusses different analog and symbolic representations and their limitations. The chapter also examines the issue of intentionality and the interpretation of representations in cognitive systems. -->{{</details>}} | 
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Tolman, E.C. (1948) | Cognitive maps in rats and men. *Image and Environment: Cognitive Mapping and Spatial Behavior*, 1948, 27-50.|
<!-- {{< details "">}} This passage discusses the concept of cognitive maps in rats and humans. It explores different viewpoints on the formation and use of these mental maps. The passage describes experiments with rats in maze navigation and how their behavior changes over time as they learn to find food more efficiently. It also discusses different schools of thought in animal psychology, with some advocating for purely stimulus-response connections and others arguing for the involvement of strengthened connections. The passage highlights the importance of determining whether cognitive maps are narrow or comprehensive and discusses the implications of these maps for animal behavior. It also describes studies that support the theory of learning involving the development of cognitive maps. Overall, the passage provides insights into the understanding of cognitive mapping abilities in rats and its implications for human behavior.  {{</details>}} -->



## Additional Readings

The presenter should read and incorporate these:

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Larkin & Simon (1987) | {{< details "Why a Diagram is (Sometimes) Worth 10,000 Words. *Cognitive Science*, 11, 65-99.">}}
{{< icon name="chalkboard-teacher" pack="fas" >}}Pop out notes with a robot icon are automatically generated paper summaries. So take them with a grain of salt!
 {{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} The article discusses the advantages of using diagrammatic representations in problem-solving. Diagrams can convey implicit information more efficiently than sentential representations. The authors examine the computational efficiency and effectiveness of both types of representations in solving mathematical and physics problems. They argue that diagrams provide explicit information at a single location, enabling smoother problem-solving processes with reduced need for search and computation.

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} van Gelder, T. (1995) | {{< details "What Might Cognition Be, If Not Computation? *The Journal of Philosophy*, 92(7), 345-381.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} In this article, the author challenges the dominant computational view of cognition and explores alternative explanations for cognitive processes. The author discusses various research programs, such as connectionism, neurocomputational approaches, and ecological psychology, that offer different conceptions of cognition.

<!-- | {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Gardner, H. (1985) | {{< details "The Mind's New Science: A history of the cognitive revolution Chapter One (on Learn)">}}

{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} The passage introduces the book "The Mind's New Science" and provides a brief overview of its content. The book focuses on current cognitive-scientific work and aims to explore fundamental philosophical questions. The author highlights the importance of resolving the computational paradox and meeting the cognitive challenge for the future of cognitive science. The book also discusses the historical background of cognitive science, dating back to classical times, and its emergence as a recognized pursuit in the last few decades.{{</details>}}| -->

## Questions under discussion

- What was the cognitive revolution?
- What are representations?
- What evidence do we have for cognitive representations?
