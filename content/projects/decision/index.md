Humans are said to be ‘predictably irrational’, departing from the ways that economists would like to think they will behave. Businesses, policy makers, marketers and consultants and increasingly economists would all like to understand how and why people make the decisions they do. The judgment and decision making topic focuses on these questions and has produced a number influential models capturing how people choose between options, often emphasizing heuristics (or computational shortcuts) we use to make choices with limited time or computational resources and trying to explicate when and why they work.

## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss.

## Secondary Readings

The presenter should read and incorporate these.

## Questions under discussion

 - What are a few of the most famous heuristics proposed in the the literature.
 - What kind of theory is Prospect theory? Normative, descriptive or prescriptive?
 - Quantum Probability models... what's going on there?
