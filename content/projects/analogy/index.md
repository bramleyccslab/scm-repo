Analogies help highlight similarities between different situations. Sometimes they just help us make pretty prose and literary points; however, they can also help us with problem solving. Is analogical reasoning responsible for creative solutions and "aha!" moments of insight?

## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss.

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Gentner, D. (1983) | Structure-mapping: A theoretical framework for analogy. *Cognitive Science*, 7(2), 155-170. |<!-- {{< details "">}}{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} The article proposes a theoretical framework for understanding analogy called structure-mapping theory. This theory emphasizes the syntactic properties of knowledge representation and distinguishes analogy from other forms of comparison. It suggests that analogies involve mapping relations between objects rather than just attributes, and the specific relations mapped are determined by systematicity. The theory argues that the strength of an analogy depends on the relevancy of certain kinds of mismatches rather than overall featural overlap. The article also discusses the representation of knowledge as propositional networks and the importance of similarity and component predicates in analogy interpretation. In addition to discussing the structure-mapping theory, the article delves into the relationship between analogy and metaphor, the role of higher-order predicates in analogical reasoning, and the importance of shared complex representational structures in scientific learning and reasoning. Overall, the structure-mapping theory provides a powerful framework for understanding analogical reasoning.{{</details>}}  -->
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Gick, M. L., & Holyoak, K. J. (1980) | Analogical problem solving. *Cognitive Psychology*, 12(3), 306-355. |<!-- {{< details "">}}{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This paper summarises various experiments conducted by Gick and Holyoak on analogical problem-solving. The studies explore how analogies can be used to generate solutions to problems, the role of story analogies in problem-solving, and factors that influence the effectiveness of analogical problem-solving. The studies find that the presence of story analogies increases the frequency of analogous solutions generated by participants, but may also limit the generation of nonanalogous solutions. Additionally, the studies highlight the importance of noticing and accessing analogies in problem-solving and the potential impact of prior problem-solving experience on the ability to solve similar problems. The research also suggests that hints and memory access can affect the use of analogies in problem-solving. Overall, the studies contribute to a better understanding of how analogies can be used in problem-solving and their limitations.{{</details>}} -->

{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This article discusses the concept of similarity and its importance in various psychological theories. The authors argue against the view that similarity is determined solely by perceptual processes and propose that it is influenced by the comparison process itself. They address criticisms of similarity and suggest that specific similarities between objects, known as "respects," are crucial for understanding similarity. The passages also explore different models and measures of similarity, the role of context and experience in similarity judgments, and the influence of comparison processes on similarity assessments. They discuss the importance of alignment in determining similarities and differences between objects and the role of constraints and global constraint satisfaction in similarity judgments. The passages highlight the dynamic and context-dependent nature of similarity and the need for further research in this area. {{</details>}} |


## Questions under discussion

- How is analogical reasoning different from similarity based reasoning?
