Space. The final frontier. How do we move in space? Vectors, scalars, navigation? Is spacial reasoning a cognitive instinct or a cognitive technology?

## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss.

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Pederson, E., Danziger, E., Wilkins, D., Levinson, S., Kita, S., & Senft, G. (1998) | {{< details "Semantic typology and spatial conceptualization.  *Language*, 74(3), 557-589.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This research project collected linguistic data on spatial relations in various languages and found that there is linguistic and cognitive variation in spatial conceptualization across different communities. The study used nonlinguistic experiments to determine if a community's cognitive frame of reference correlates with their linguistic frame of reference, and the findings suggest that language and thought are intertwined in spatial conceptualization. The research emphasizes the importance of incorporating cultural and linguistic input in conceptual representations and challenges assumptions about what is considered universal in spatial cognition. The study expands on previous linguistic relativity research by considering a broad range of languages and patterns of language use. It discusses semantic typology, functional equivalence in languages, and the use of different frames of reference in spatial descriptions. The study also explores the relationship between language and conceptual representation, as well as the impact of language on nonverbal problem-solving strategies and cognitive spatial relations. The findings contribute to our understanding of linguistic relativity and its potential impact on human cognition.{{</details>}} |

{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} In summary, the articles and content mentioned above explore various aspects of semantic typology, spatial adpositions, crosslinguistic comparisons, and the relationship between language, cognition, and spatial concepts. They discuss the challenges of categorizing and generalizing spatial adpositions, the role of methodology in comparative semantics research, the use of adpositions and locative nouns in different languages, and the exploration of adpositional groupings and semantic spaces. The articles also propose hypotheses, models, and statistical analyses to better understand the organization and universality of spatial concepts.{{</details>}} |

## Secondary Readings

The presenter should read and incorporate these.

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Li, P., & Gleitman, L. (2002) | {{< details "Turning the tables: Language and spatial reasoning. *Cognition*, 83(3), 265-294.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This passage summarizes various research papers and studies that explore the effects of language on spatial organization, reasoning, and cognition. The Whorf-Sapir linguistic relativity hypothesis, which suggests that language influences thought, is discussed. The studies reviewed investigate how different languages use different spatial systems and how cultural factors can impact spatial terminology and cognitive strategies. The presence and suitability of local landmark cues are found to play a role in problem-solving strategies. The passage also mentions research on spatial reasoning in animals and prelinguistic infants, highlighting their ability to adapt spatial reasoning based on the presence of landmark cues. The authors emphasize the relationship between language and thought but note that human thought is robust to variation in linguistic usage patterns. {{</details>}} |
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Levinson, S. C., Kita, S., Haun, D. B., & Rasch, B. H. (2002) | {{< details "Returning the tables: Language affects spatial reasoning. *Cognition*, 84(2), 155-188.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} The study explores the relationship between language and spatial reasoning, arguing against a cross-cultural comparison that suggests language has a causal effect on non-linguistic thinking. The authors conduct experiments to support their hypothesis that language does not have a direct effect on cognition in the spatial domain. {{</details>}} |


## Questions under discussion

- What are the natural concepts for space?
- Are spatial concepts a cognitive universal or driven by language?
