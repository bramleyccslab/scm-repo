While Sherlock's over there blogging *The Science of Deduction*, I'd argue most of human reasoning is **inductive**. We see lot's of examples (e.g., 10 million white swans) and then try to explain them (swans are white). Checks out, right?

## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss.

## Secondary Readings

The presenter should read and incorporate these.

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Goyal, A., & Bengio, Y. (2020). | Inductive biases for deep learning of higher-level cognition. *arXiv preprint* arXiv:2011.15091. |

## Questions under discussion

- How/do humans rationally solve the problem of induction?
- What are inductive biases and what are they good for?
