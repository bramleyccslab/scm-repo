“Concepts are the glue that holds our mental world together. When we walk into a room, try a new restaurant, go to the supermarket to buy groceries, meet a doctor, or read a story, we must rely on our concepts of the world to help us understand what is happening.” (Murphy, 2002, p1).

This session will explore recent attempts to model the structure of human concepts with an emphasis on symbolic “language of thought”-flavored approaches. These seek to explain not just how we use concepts to categorize things, but also how we can combine and repurpose them in the creative generation of novel ideas and solutions.


## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss.

## Secondary Readings

The presenter should read and incorporate these.

## Questions under discussion

- How do concepts relate to categories?
- What about to other previous topics? e.g. Are concepts representations? Are objects concepts?
- What is the idea of learning as program induction? Is it in tension with connectionist ideas about learning?
