*“Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs.”* (Dennett, The Intentional Stance, 1996, p. 17).


This session will think about how people reason about others and how we might make machines that can do the same.

## Questions under discussion

 - Can you think of situations where people make the wrong theory of mind ascriptions (i.e. something with little or no mental life that we we assume does have it, and visa versa)?
 - What are some challenges for developing artificial agents with theory of mind
 - Is the Baron-Cohen view of autism still current?
