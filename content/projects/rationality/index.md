In popular culture, we often think of *rationality* as in tension with *intuition*. We see this in caricatures of hyper-rational agents like Spock in Star Trek. The probabilistic revolution in cognitive science has changed this notion. It is not rational to treat every task as logical deduction when the world itself is underdetermined and radically uncertain. This session will explore the notion of being rational in an uncertain world.

## Questions under discussion

 - What does it mean to be rational?
 - What does probability theory have to do with it?
 - What does it mean to be boundedly rational or resource rational?
 - Broadly speaking, are people any of the above?
