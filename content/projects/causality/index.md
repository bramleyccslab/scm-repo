The search for a causal understanding of the world is at the heart of human cognition. It shapes learning throughout development and guides intelligent behaviour by allowing cognisers to predict outcomes, selectively gather information, attribute blame and credit, and imagine hypothetical and counterfactual situations. Causal reasoning is also central to the scientific method, underpinning how we, as scientists, design experiments, build and evaluate theories including the ones we use to describe and understand our own minds.

In this session, we will think about how to model the cognition involved in learning, representing and exploiting a causal model of the world.

## Questions under discussion

- What are the levels of Pearlâ€™s Ladder of Causation?
- What makes an intervention valuable?
- What are counterfactuals and what role do they play in reasoning?
