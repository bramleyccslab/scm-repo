*“For all the points of the compass, there’s only one direction and time is its only measure.”* (Stoppard, 1966)

Unlike most computational systems, humans experience their environment through time. One of the most basic forms of human and animal learning is to associate things that happen close together. Everyday activities like speech, music, dance demand precise time control, while imagination, mental simulation, and memory (“mental time travel”) seem to require encoding of (and ability to regenerate events) in the right temporal sequence. What then is the role of time in the various cognitive processes and representations we have been discussing throughout this course?

## Questions under discussion

- How veridical is our perception of the time course of events and actions?
- What problem do RNNs try to solve and how well do you think they achieve this?
- How might time help us encode non-temporal things like relations?
