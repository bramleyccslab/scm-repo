From pouring a cup of coffee to playing frogger through the streets, physical reasoning is ubiquitous in human behavior. Arguably these goals have been stable throughout the evolution of our species, so are we optimal physical reasoners? 


## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss:

|  |  |
|:----:|:-----|
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} McCloskey, M. (1983) | Intuitive physics. *Scientific American*, 248(4), 122-131. |<!-- {{< details "">}}{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} The article explores the discrepancies between people's intuitive understanding of physics and the principles of Newtonian mechanics. The author presents several studies conducted to uncover the misconceptions and intuitive beliefs that many individuals hold about the motion of objects in various scenarios. {{</details>}} -->
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Battaglia, P. W., Hamrick, J. B., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2013) | Simulation as an engine of physical scene understanding. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 110(45), 18327-18332.  |
<!-- {{< details "">}}{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This research article introduces a model called the Intuitive Physics Engine (IPE) that uses approximate and probabilistic simulations to understand how people perceive and understand physical scenes. The model is based on computer engines used in video games and graphics and fits data from psychophysical tasks, captures illusions and biases, and explains core aspects of human mental models and common-sense reasoning. The article argues that understanding physical scenes is crucial for human interaction with the world and is linked to higher cognitive processes. The IPE model is shown to be able to compute intuitive inferences about scenes and capture how predictions are affected by factors such as object properties and applied forces.{{</details>}}  -->

## Secondary Readings

The presenter should read and incorporate these:

|  |  |
|:----:|:-----|
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Ludwin-Peery, E., Bramley, N. R., Davis, E., & Gureckis, T. M. (2020) | {{< details "Broken physics: A conjunction fallacy effect in intuitive physical reasoning. *Psychological Science*, 31 (12), 1602-1611.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} The article investigates the conjunction fallacy in our ability to reason about physical events. Three experiments were conducted, and the results consistently showed that participants rated conjunction of two physical events as more likely than at least one of the constituent events in the same scenes. This raises questions about current theories of mental simulation in physical reasoning.
{{< icon name="chalkboard-teacher" pack="fas" >}} Relating to the primary readings, does this fit better with McCloskey's view that physical reasoning is based on heuristic rules, or Battaglia et al's view that it is based on detailed simulations?{{</details>}}   |
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Gerstenberg, T., Goodman, N. D., Lagnado, D. A., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2021). | {{< details "A counterfactual simulation model of causal judgments for physical events. *Psychological Review*, 128(5), 936.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} 
This article discusses the Counterfactual Simulation Model (CSM) and its application in understanding causal judgments in physical events. The CSM aims to predict how people make causal judgments by comparing what actually happened with what could have happened. The model is tested in experiments and provides a better fit than heuristic models. It captures different aspects of causation and can be used to model the semantics of causal verbs.
{{< icon name="chalkboard-teacher" pack="fas" >}} Relating to the Causality topic, what rung of causal reasoning is this?{{</details>}} |




## Questions under discussion

- How do humans represent physical knowledge and use that knowledge to achieve their goals?
- Are we optimal physical reasoners?
