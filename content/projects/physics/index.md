From pouring a cup of coffee to playing frogger through the streets, physical reasoning is ubiquitous in human behavior. Arguably these goals have been stable throughout the evolution of our species, so are we optimal physical reasoners?

## Questions under discussion

- How do humans represent physical knowledge and use that knowledge to achieve their goals?
- Are we optimal physical reasoners?
