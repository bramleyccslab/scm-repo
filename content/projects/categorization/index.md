Plato famously characterised humans as seeking to ‘carve nature at its joints’ (Phaedrus). The rough idea is that we find ways to classify and group the things in our experience in ways that somehow respect their natural clustering and separation.

This topic looks at cognitive models that have tried to capture how and why we partition the world in the ways we do.
