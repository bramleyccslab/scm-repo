Light hits our eyes  and somehow we perceive 3 dimensional 'objects'. 
What is an object? 
In representational systems like programming languages, objects are core structure. 
Is the same true for our cognitive system? Are objects learned or innate?

Similar to object, events seem like a great candidate for an ontological type. Formal semanticists have illustrated time and time again that they are important for explaining language. But are events core conceptual knowledge?

## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss.

|:----:|:-----|
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Spelke, E.S. (1990) | {{< details "Principles of object perception. *Cognitive Science*, 14(1), 29-56. ">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} In this study, Elizabeth S. Spelke from Cornell University explores research on human infants' perception of objects based on surface arrangements and motions. The study suggests that infants perceive objects as connected wholes, separate entities, and maintain their size and shape over motion. The findings indicate that there is a representation of object unity and boundaries between surfaces and familiar objects. Additionally, the study proposes that perception develops through experience and enhances perceptual abilities without fundamentally changing them. {{</details>}}
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Zacks, J. M., & Tversky, B. (2001) | {{< details "Event structure in perception and conception. *Psychological Bulletin*, 127(1), 3. ">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This article discusses the importance of event structure in perception, comprehension, memory, planning, and action. It suggests that events, like objects, have categories and parts, and understanding these relationships can enhance cognitive processes. The article explores the hierarchical nature of events and how they can be categorized and segmented based on different factors. It also discusses the role of language in event perception and the influence of goals and causal interactions on event recognition. The text highlights the similarities and differences between objects and events and emphasizes the importance of structured representations in understanding and remembering events.

The article also discusses the role of event schemata and goals in comprehension and memory recall. It further explores how event perception and cognition involve the interaction of different information sources and the limitations of hierarchical partonomic hierarchies. The article concludes with a list of references related to event perception, cognition, and memory.{{</details>}} |

## Secondary Readings

The presenter should read and incorporate at least two of these.

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Fillmore, C. J. (1970) | {{< details "The grammar of hitting and breaking. *Readings in English Transformational Grammar*, 120-133. (on Learn)">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This research explores the distinction between implicit and explicit knowledge of language, focusing on the verbs "hit" and "break" in English. Fillmore argues that while speakers may struggle to explain the usage and meaning of these words, they rarely make mistakes when using them. He emphasizes the need for linguistic observations to be incorporated into an empirical theory of linguistic structure. It explores the ambiguity of sentences and the role of body-part nouns in indicating places rather than objects. {{</details>}} |
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Lettvin, J. Y. et al., (1957) | {{< details "What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain. *Proceedings of the IRE*, 47(11), 1940-1951. ">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}}  This paper presents research on the activity of single fibers in the optic nerve of frogs. The authors investigate what kind of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and what aspect of that stimulus is most excitatory. They find that the pattern of local variation in intensity, rather than the light intensity itself, is the most excitatory factor for the frog's eye. The study provides a detailed analysis of the anatomy, physiology, and behavior of the frog's visual apparatus. The research emphasizes that the frog's eye informs the brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern, independent of average illumination. The findings suggest that the frog's visual system is highly organized and interpreted, and not simply transmitting an accurate copy of the distribution of light.{{</details>}}
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Biederman, I. (1987) | {{< details "Recognition-by-Components: A Theory of Human Image Understanding. *Psychological Review*, 94(2), 115. ">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This article discusses the theory of recognition-by-components (RBC) in human image understanding. The theory proposes that objects are perceived by segmenting the input image into simple geometric components called geons. These geons can be derived from the contrasts of certain properties of edges in the image. The theory suggests that object recognition is robust and invariant to changes in viewing position and image quality. Experimental findings support the theory.

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Scholl, Brian J. (2007) | {{< details "Object persistence in philosophy and psychology. *Mind & Language*, 22(5), 563-591.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}}  This article explores the concept of object persistence in both philosophy and psychology. It suggests that there are similarities between these two fields, indicating that psychological mechanisms may underlie the intuitions about persistence that fuel metaphysical theories. The goal is to bridge the gap between cognitive science and metaphysics and potentially contribute to philosophical progress. The article discusses themes such as spatiotemporal continuity, persistence through property change, and cohesion, and how these themes have led to empirical discoveries in psychological research. It also explores various scenarios and challenges our intuitions about the identity and persistence of objects over time. The article highlights the importance of cohesion as a principle for object persistence and discusses the role of intuitions and psychological mechanisms in influencing our judgments and interpretations. It also considers the potential for psychology to contribute to philosophy in understanding the origins of metaphysical intuitions.{{</details>}} |
<!-- | {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Cavanaugh, P. (2011) | {{< details "Visual cognition. *Vision Research*, 51(13), 1538-1551.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This article discusses various aspects of visual cognition, including visual executive functions, attention, object recognition, motion perception, and the role of shadows in perception. The authors highlight the need for further research in these areas to better understand the mechanisms underlying visual cognition and its interaction with other cognitive processes. {{</details>}}  | -->

## Questions under discussion

- How do we represent object information?
- What's missing from these representations?
- Events: linguistic artifact or core knowledge?
