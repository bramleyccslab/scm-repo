Cognitive Science is the science of mental representations and processes. What are processes?

## Primary Readings

Everyone should read these and be prepared to discuss.

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Donders, F.C. (1898) | {{< details "On the speed of mental processes. *Acta psychologica*, 30, 412-431.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} A discussion of various experiments conducted by different researchers to understand the duration of mental processes. The experiments involve measuring the conduction time for sensory nerves in the brain, determining the conduction velocity of nerves, and measuring the time required for decision-making processes. The results of these experiments show that the duration of mental processes can vary depending on the stimulus and the complexity of the task. The researchers also highlight the importance of accurately measuring and recording the timing of stimuli and responses. While these experiments provide valuable insights into the timing of mental processes, they do not offer definitive answers and further research is needed. {{</details>}} |
| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Sternberg, S. (1966) | {{< details "Memory Scanning: Mental Processes Revealed by Reaction-Time Experiments. *American scientist*, 57(4), 421-457.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This article  explores the use of reaction-time experiments to understand the mental processes involved in memory scanning. The article discusses the stage theory of information processing and the subtraction method used to analyze reaction times. It explores the differences between simple exhaustive search and self-terminating search processes. The article also discusses the memory processes involved in storing and retrieving information.

<!-- The study examines the effects of stimulus degradation, stimulus quality, and set size on item recognition. It suggests that sensory characteristics play a role in item-recognition tasks and that the scanning process is not solely dependent on verbalization or stimulus identity. The research also explores the effects of active and inactive memory on item recognition and the importance of rehearsal in memory retrieval. It suggests that rehearsal serves to maintain short-term memory and make information stored in long-term memory more readily accessible. The article concludes by discussing the efficiency of exhaustive scanning in item recognition tasks and the importance of the scanning process in memory retrieval. The research supports the idea of stages of processing and suggests that factors influencing these stages have additive effects on response time. -->

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Smith, P.L. & Ratcliff, R. (1995) | {{< details "An Introduction to the Diffusion Model of Decision Making. In _An introduction to model-based cognitive Neuroscience_ (pp. 49-70). Springer, New York, NY.">}}
{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} The diffusion model of decision making is introduced in this chapter. The model assumes that decisions are made by accumulating noisy evidence until reaching a response criterion. The time taken to reach criterion determines the decision time, while the response is determined by which criterion is reached first. The chapter describes the main features of the model, methods for obtaining response time predictions, fitting it to experimental data, and representing the fit graphically. The model is compared to other models and is the most widely applied to empirical data in psychology. The diffusion model focuses on two-alternative decision tasks and uses continuous-time versions of random walks to interpret evidence. The model predicts choice probabilities and response time distributions and has been extensively studied. It can account for speed-accuracy trade-offs and bias effects in decision making. The chapter also discusses the links between evidence accumulation and processes in psychology and neuroscience. Overall, the diffusion model provides a useful tool for analyzing decision-making data and understanding the cognitive processes involved.

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Meyer, D.E. & Schvaneveldt, R. (1976) | {{< details "Meaning, Memory Structure and Mental Processes: People's rapid reactions to words help reveal how stored semantic information is retrieved. *Science*, 192(4234), 27-33">}}

{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This passage provides an overview of a research study conducted by experimental psychologists on human learning and memory, with a focus on semantic information retrieval. The study used a reaction time method to measure word recognition and sentence comprehension. The researchers manipulated set relations and sizes of categories in sentences and found that reaction times were faster when the meanings of category names were closely related and slower when the sizes of the categories mentioned were more different from each other. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to a model of human memory and the effects of category size on reaction times.

<!-- The passage also mentions the influence of semantic relatedness on word recognition and the role of visual feature analyzers and word detectors in this process. Furthermore, the inhibition and facilitation of sentence comprehension based on word meanings are explored, raising questions about the storage and use of semantic information in human memory.

The passage concludes by highlighting the significance of research on mental processes involved in understanding words and sentences, with the potential for further investigation using the reaction-time method to gain a more detailed understanding of information retrieval from memory. -->

| {{< icon name="scroll" pack="fas" >}} Shiffrin and Schneider (1977) | {{< details "Controlled and Automatic Human Information Processing: II. Perceptual Learning, Automatic Attending, and a General Theory. *Psychological Review*, 84 (2)">}}

{{< icon name="robot" pack="fas" >}} This article presents a series of experiments that explore the two-process theory of human information processing, specifically focusing on automatic detection and controlled search. The experiments manipulate variables such as frame size, memory-set size, and mapping procedure to investigate the differences between these modes and their impact on attention. The results suggest that automatic attention can be learned in certain paradigms and that the presence of categories can improve performance in controlled search and facilitate the development of automatic detection.

<!-- The article also discusses the framework for understanding human information processing, distinguishing between automatic and controlled processes and emphasizing the role of attention in controlled processes. It highlights the importance of training for automatic processes and the difficulty in suppressing or altering them once learned. The article further explores the coexistence and advantages of both automatic and controlled processing systems.

Overall, the research contributes to the existing theories of search and attention, providing insights on perceptual learning, automatic attending, and the role of categories in information processing. It also raises new research questions and suggests potential applications for these findings in various attention tasks. -->

## Questions under discussion

- How can we measure mental processes from behaviors?
