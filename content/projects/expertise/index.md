Most of us specialize in something in our lives, perhaps even achieving expert status. Gladwell once claimed that 10,000 hours of practice in anything is enough to make anyone an expert. While this has been roundly [debunked](https://www.6seconds.org/2022/06/20/10000-hour-rule/), large neural network models are now able to achieve expert or superhuman ability when given enough millions of training episodes for a single task.

On the other hand, these models struggle far more than people to *generalize* this expertis to even slightly different tasks, or indeed to master more than one thing at all. What is expertise in cognition? This session will explore how we can model expertise, how expertise changes our how a cognizer approaches a task, and what trade-offs this can come with.

## Questions under discussion

- What differences do we see in how experts and novices approach a problem?
- What are some features of domain expertise?
- In what ways might expertise trade off with flexibility?
