## Do I need to pass the assignments to pass the course?

No -- you will pass if (and only if) your **combined** mark is above 40%.

## Can I get an extension for an assignment?

For the portfolio, there are no extensions. You can miss 2 entries, no questions asked.

For the presentation, there are no extensions. If you are ill, you get one chance to reschedule. That said, [special circumstances](https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/extensions-special-circumstances/students/special-circumstances-explained) happen and are handled by the ITO.

For the essay, the ITO is responsible for granting extensions. They can grant extensions that
are requested BEFORE the assignment deadline.

For more information, see the school's guidance on
[late coursework and extension requests](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests).

## I accidentally submitted the wrong file(s) for an assignment. Can I send you the correct file after the deadline?

If you submitted a partially complete assignment before the deadline, that is
what will be marked. If you submitted an empty assignment or the wrong file
before the deadline, you can submit after the deadline but it will be treated
as a late submission. After you submit an assignment, download and open what you
submitted to be sure you submitted the correct file.

## Do we have to buy any books?

No.

All of the readings are be available online via google scholar and the university's journal subscriptions. Learning to source journal articles online is a useful incidental skill you will build during this course. 
Particularly hard to find readings with copyright protections will be made available on Learn.

## There are lots of pages of readings. Are they all required?

Yes. This is a seminar course -_-

You need to show up to class ready to discuss the readings. That doesn't mean you have to understand everything or have a strong opinion about it.
